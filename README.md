# SEI 23 (Project 2 - Task List Tracker): https://guarded-hamlet-21547.herokuapp.com/

## Description:
Most people will mix-up the priority on what things to do. The purpose of this app is to allow users post their task which can be shared with friends for accountability. With a to-do-list, the User could check on the progress of the task shared with friends and continue. Friends could leave comments to check in with their friend and remind/encourage the user of their task/goals.

## Minimum functionality:
- [x] View Post, Create Post, Update Post and Delete Post
- [x] to-do-list
- [x] Sign up/Log in functionality
- [x] 3 Models, 3 Routes and EJS templetes

## Further:
- Make the website responsive by implementing bootstrap css
- Interactive with the users able to leave their comments
- Allows only users to edit/delete, while public could only view on the posts
- Private to-do-list for the users.
